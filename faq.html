            <h4>How do I get to Greece ?</h4>
            <p>The orography of Greece makes flying the easiest and cheapest option. 
                The main airport is Athens International Airport Eleftherios Venizelos. A round trip ticket from France costs around 200€.
                From there you can fly to the most popular greek islands, which have their own airport. 
                Alternatively, you can get to Patras port by ferry from Venice, Italy. 
                It is also possible to get from Paris to Athens in 3 stops which takes around 3 days : Paris → Zurich → Belgrade → Thessaloniki.</p>

            <h4>How can I get around in Greece ?</h4>
            <p>If you’re interested in utilizing public transit on the mainland, stick to buses and avoid the unreliable rail service. 
                Although trains are cheap, they are slow and not as well maintained as other lines in Europe. 
                However, buses are clean, affordable, and connect to a broad network of destinations throughout the country.  
                Athens has an accessible, affordable and modern Metro that will take you to key points of interest and the port of Piraeus.</p>

            <h4>How long should I stay ?</h4>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>What currency does Greece use ?</h4>

                Nonetheless it is respectful to learn a few basic Greek words like "Please" (parakalo) and "thank you" (efharisto), to better conect with locals.

                In summer don't forget sunscreen, sunglasses and a hat.</p>
